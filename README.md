# FleshLeather

Baby's first Spigot plugin. I made it because I couldn't find a rotten flesh-smelting plugin that didn't throw an error about legacy resources whenever I booted my server up, and figured that was a good enough excuse to write a plugin of my own. Super simple, just adds three recipes and calls it good.

## FEATURES

- Smelt rotten flesh to leather in a furnace, smoker or on a campfire
- Same XP yield as making charcoal
- That's literally it

Thanks for coming to my high-effort, low-yield solution to my logs not being perfectly error-free despite the game working right!
